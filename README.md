# SpaceX Challenge

A project I built over approximately 6 hours, I decided not to use any libraries or packages as the user stories were relatively straightforward.
I split the layout primarily using flexbox. 
My containers hold all my logic and act as my 'controller' and the components themselves are for the view.
